This project is a data analysis of Uber trip records using Python and machine learning. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models to understand trip demand patterns. Key insights include peak ride times, high-demand areas, and factors affecting trip frequency. Machine learning models like Linear Regression and Decision Tree are used to forecast future demand. The project uses libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, and is presented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.
